# Project 2025  

Welcome to **Project 2025**! 🎉  

This repository is a personal initiative to document my learning journey as I work on one project every month throughout the year 2025. As a BCA student at SMIT, Sikkim, I aim to explore various technologies, programming concepts, and real-world applications through hands-on projects.  

## 🚀 Objectives  
- Create one meaningful project every month.  
- Strengthen my programming and problem-solving skills.  
- Explore tools and technologies relevant to the industry.  
- Share my journey with the tech community.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
Each project will have its own folder, containing:  
- **Source code**: All scripts, programs, or notebooks used in the project.  
- **Documentation**: Instructions, explanations, and insights about the project.  
- **Resources**: Any additional files, datasets, or references.
